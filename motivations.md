I want to increase my value by learning a hard skill that I can use to develop and/or maintain necessary programs in the new technological world we all live in.
I want software development to lead me to a life with a great work life balance, and the ability to work remotely when the time comes.  I'm not willing to wait until retirement to explore.
I can see my future in my current position and I want to make moves to change it.
